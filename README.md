- 👋 Hi, I’m @posel, an developer in the Czech-based company www.pdqm.cz, but my major job is the AyMINE solution - www.aymine.com
- 👀 I’m interested in the object-based application frameworks and my favorite landscape are the enterprise database systems but made in the scope reliable even for the smallest business
- I really dislike large IT mastodonts that are trying the consume all competition as an afternoon snack 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build up market position
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a network of companies supporting smaller and midsize business using the AyMINE Framework not only for quality management but also as a primary solution for everyday business management.
- In the best I hope to open the AyMINE framework as the new alternative for 21st centure that surpass 15+ years old back-end frameworks based on the server-generated pages.
- 📫 The easiest way to reach me is here :) but the second way is over the aymine contact
